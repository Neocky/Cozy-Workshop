She gifted me this diary to write from time to time so one day I can look back onto my life. \\n \\nAfter our wedding we found a place for our new house. Currently I am still building it with lumber from the old wood mill. Construction is not a problem as I am a carpenter. The problem is the place. This cursed place. \\nAfter we laid down the foundation the problems started to arise. First the land was uneven and we needed to make some landscaping changes. After we build the foundation the second problem arised quickly. The foundation sunk a little. It sunk! We could fix the problems but the house got more expensive. \\nOur money is currently short and we need to stretch the budget. My Wife started working on the fields again to earn something. I didn't want her to start working there again but she insisted. \\nI hope this nightmare ends soon...",
    "mp.quest.diary.entry_2.desc": "After weeks of hard work we finished building our house. It is finally done. I can't believe it. \\n We moved into it and since then we didn't have any money issues anymore. Currently I am building furniture for other people in the village and my wife quit the field work. Now she takes care of our chickens. To celebrate our new home I bought my wife a cow from a bonus I got for a nice desk I had build. She cried of joy and named the cow Moo. Yes just Moo. \\nSince then we have fresh milk every morning with nice eggs from our chickens for breakfast. \\n \\nSo whats next? \\n \\nI am currently looking to build a small shack next to the house to use as a workshop and my wife talks about getting more animals. I just hope that she finds a better name for the poor animals.",
    "mp.quest.diary.entry_3.desc": "The winter came and the carpenter jobs dried up. This was expected. \\nIn the meantime I finished building my workshop where I'm currently writing from. It has a nice long table where I can tinker with stuff and where I spend my days until sunset. My goal is to create something from milk that we can sell to others in the village. \\nI started with heating milk and adding some ingredients. The most prominent candidate right now is sugar from sugar canes. With milk and sugar it creates a sweet fluid. But there is still something missing and I'm searching for the last ingredient until the taste is just perfect. \\nI hope that this will help so we will never have to worry about money anymore.",
    "mp.quest.diary.entry_4.desc": "Cocoa Beans! Cocoa Beans were missing in the recipe. \\nMilk heated with Sugar and Cocoa Beans create a sweet creamy fluid. When pressed into a form and letting it cool of it creates a nice brown bar which tastes really good and is sweet. I named this new food Chocolate. My wife loves the new Chocolate Bars and the kids in town too. \\n \\nI just need to find a way to produce them in large quantities... \\nWe will be rich! We will never ever have to work again! When I tell that my wife she will cry of joy. I need to talk to her. We need more cows which produce milk. And more sugar canes. And more coca beans.",
    "mp.quest.diary.entry_5.desc": "We got more cows. We now have 6! \\nI created a new machine which produces new Chocolate Bars every day. Milk, Sugar and Cocoa Beans get heated and pressed into a bar and then get cooled down. Everything happens automatically. \\nMy wife thinks this &othing of mine&r will grow over my head. She has no idea. I do that for us so she doesn't need to work on a field again. She will never need to work again! \\n \\nI just need to get the recipe perfect. I can't sell some half good Chocolate Bars in the village. They need to be perfect. Perfect!",
    "mp.quest.diary.entry_6.desc": "I need more room. The workshop is full. Everything is full of machines which create Chocolate Bars. The rest is full of Chocolate Bars itself. \\nI can't sell them yet. The recipe is not perfect. I need to make more. I needed more room. \\nSo I started to build machines in our house. My wife didn't like it. She hated it and screamed at me that I should stop. She cried and asked what happened to me. I said I am doing everything for her. This is all for her. She didn't understand me. \\n \\nShe left... \\n \\nI am alone...\\n \\nI have room for the new machines. I started building and couldn't stop. Everything is full again. The factory must grow. I need to make more. Need to make more Chocolate Bars. Chocolate Bars. My Chocolate Bars!",

I just know that I need it. \\n \\nI searched for you but you weren't there. You know I did it for you. Everything was for you.\\n \\nWe were happy... But we both left.\\n \\n-Goodbye, Willy",
